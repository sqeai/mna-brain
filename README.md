## Getting started

### Install the CLI

Available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) as dev dependency. To install:

```bash
pnpm i supabase --save-dev
```

When installing with yarn 4, you need to disable experimental fetch with the following nodejs config.

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch yarn add supabase
```

> **Note**
For Bun versions below v1.0.17, you must add `supabase` as a [trusted dependency](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) before running `bun add -D supabase`.

  #### via Homebrew

  To install:

  ```sh
  brew install supabase/tap/supabase
  ```

  To upgrade:

  ```sh
  brew upgrade supabase
  ```

  #### via Linux packages

  Linux packages are provided in [Releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases). To install, download the `.apk`/`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.pkg.tar.zst` file depending on your package manager and run the respective commands.

  ```sh
  sudo apk add --allow-untrusted <...>.apk
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo dpkg -i <...>.deb
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo rpm -i <...>.rpm
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo pacman -U <...>.pkg.tar.zst
  ```

  <summary><b>Other Platforms</b></summary>

  You can also install the CLI via [go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install) without the help of package managers.

  ```sh
  go install github.com/supabase/cli@latest
  ```

  Add a symlink to the binary in `$PATH` for easier access:

  ```sh
  ln -s "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/cli" /usr/bin/supabase
  ```

  This works on other non-standard Linux distros.

  <summary><b>Community Maintained Packages</b></summary>

  Available via [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh/). Package script [here](https://github.com/pkgxdev/pantry/blob/main/projects/supabase.com/cli/package.yml).
  To install in your working directory:

  ```bash
  pkgx install supabase
  ```

  Available via [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/). Package script [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/tools/supabase-cli/default.nix).

### Run the CLI

```bash
supabase bootstrap
```

Or using npx:

```bash
npx supabase bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command will guide you through the process of setting up a Supabase project using one of the [starter](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-samples/blob/main/samples.json) templates.

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```

## End-to-end tests

E2E tests live in `./e2e` and run with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) against a Next.js dev server. `playwright.config.ts` launches `pnpm dev` automatically and reuses an existing server if one is already running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### First-time setup

Install the Playwright browser binaries once per machine:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install
```

### Run the tests

```bash
# all tests, headless
pnpm test:e2e

# interactive UI mode (watch, re-run, time-travel)
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# a specific spec file
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/dashboard.spec.ts

# a single test by name
pnpm exec playwright test -g "paginates at 10 items per page"

# headed / debug
pnpm exec playwright test --headed
pnpm exec playwright test --debug
```

### View the report

After a run, open the HTML report:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests for backend code under `src/lib` use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). Files
colocated next to the code they cover with a `.test.ts` suffix.

```bash
pnpm test          # run once
pnpm test:watch    # watch mode
```

## Async jobs

Long-running work (AI screening, company analysis, market screening, slide
generation) is dispatched via `JobDispatcher`/`dispatchJob`, which inserts a row
into the `jobs` table and schedules the work via Next.js `after()`. The runner
transitions the row through `pending → running → completed | failed | timed_out`,
and every state change is appended to `job_logs`.

### Stuck-job cleanup scheduler

If a request is aborted before `after()` fires, a job can get stuck in `pending`
forever; if the runner process crashes mid-work, a job can get stuck in
`running`. A background sweep (`JobService.cleanupStuckJobs`) transitions any
`pending` or `running` rows whose age exceeds `timeout_seconds + buffer` into
`timed_out`, writing a `job_logs` entry that records the forced transition.

The sweep runs in-process via `src/lib/jobs/scheduler.ts`. `setInterval` isn't
viable on serverless (the function freezes between requests), so the scheduler
is triggered by two request-adjacent hooks:

1. **Cold start** — `src/instrumentation.ts` fires `runSchedulerIfDue` once per
   Node runtime init. Fire-and-forget so cold-start latency is unaffected.
2. **Job dispatch** — `dispatchJob` schedules a second `after()` that calls
   the same function. Guarantees the sweep runs even if cold starts are rare.

Every trigger is gated by a 24h DB window: `runSchedulerIfDue` queries the
most recent `stuck_cleanup` job row and skips if one was created within the
last 24h. Each sweep that actually runs is itself inserted as a
`stuck_cleanup` job, producing standard `job_logs` transitions
(`pending → running → completed`) for observability. A per-process
`inFlight` promise coalesces concurrent triggers.

Trade-offs:

- If the deployment has no cold starts and no job dispatches for 24h, no sweep
  runs. That's fine: no activity ⇒ no new stuck jobs.
- Multi-instance deployments can race — two cold starts within a few ms of
  each other could both see "no recent sweep" and both dispatch. Cleanup is
  idempotent, so at worst two sweeps run in the same window.

There's also a manual trigger at `GET /api/cron/cleanup-jobs` (useful for ops
or incident response). Pass `?force=true` to bypass the 24h window. Protect
it by setting `CRON_SECRET` and sending `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`.

```bash
# respects the 24h window
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://<host>/api/cron/cleanup-jobs
# force an immediate sweep
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "https://<host>/api/cron/cleanup-jobs?force=true"
```
